CSS Style Sheets and CSS Layout
Due:  10/10/21 @ 11:59pm
Points: 20
This exercise will explore the "internal style sheet", "in-line style" and "external style sheet".

You will create a sub-folder/directory in your html1 folder called "lab1" and three (3) pages titled, week6_lab1.html, week6_lab2.html, and week6_lab3.html

Directions

Go to the W3Schools tutorial on using CSS (Links to an external site.) to create a web layout. You will be using the two examples on that page: CSS float and Flexbox.

HTML Layout Elements and Techniques (w3schools.com) (Links to an external site.)

Color resources:

Predefined CSS Colors (w3schools.com) (Links to an external site.)
Hexadecimal W3 Schools Colors CSS HEX Colors (w3schools.com) (Links to an external site.)
Steps:
Copy the code into NotePad++ or any code editor you are using.  Use HTML Comment syntax to comment your name and the date of completion toward the top of your webpages.

Add the 5 required meta tags discussed in class to the HTML document and change the content attribute to reflect the site information for keywords, description and author meta tags.

You are going to modify the internal CSS of two pages. The third page you will call an external CSS page.

Page 1:

Modify the internal CSS at the top of the page to reflect changes in the body and nav style 
Change this page to have the nav float right.
Change the header and nav background color, font style
Add a "nav a" style to change the link color
Add in-line css to the <div class="article"> and input the four declarations listed below.  Hint: style attribute is needed
font-family: 'Amatic SC', cursive;
color: white;
padding: 3%;
font-size: 2vw;
Page 2:

Change the second page to be the Flex Box style in the W3 Schools example.
CSS Flexbox (Flexible Box) (w3schools.com) (Links to an external site.)
Change the flex container background color
Change flex-wrap from nowrap to wrap
Change the .flex-container > div 
font-size 
margin
Replace the numbers in the example with a word or image
Should look like the example on the right ->
Resize the page by making it smaller and watch the flexbox flex!

Page 3:

Create an external CSS file and link to it that style sheet.
